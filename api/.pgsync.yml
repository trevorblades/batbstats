# source database URL
# database URLs take the format of:
#   postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname
#
# we recommend a command which outputs a database URL
# so sensitive information is not included in this file
#
# we *highly recommend* you use sslmode=verify-full when possible
# see https://ankane.org/postgres-sslmode-explained for more info
from: $(echo $DATABASE_URL)?sslmode=require

# destination database URL
to: postgres://localhost:5432/batbstats
